For testers, please print in high temp filament. PLA and PLA+ will warp at the area closest to the heatblock. I print mine in CF petg 

If printing in ABS, please remember to have scale for shrinkage. 

holes on the self tap version are design at 3mm to accomodate for some shrinkage during print.

mount holes BLT bracket, fan duct bracket are slotted for 1-1.5mm for adjustments 

fanduct has a +-2mm vertical and +-0.7mm horizontal for adjustments 

Once again this is a beta version and for testers only. I would apperciate greatly for the feedback. 

Thanks and good luck.
